A simple rule to play : Moving your black grid around until getting a complete picure.

There are 5 levels from easy to hard.

Score'll be caculated by time.

INSTRUCTION'll display on waiting screen !

Must install SDL2, SDL2_ttf to run code, or just download the full_puzzle.rar to play.

GOOD LUCK :))
